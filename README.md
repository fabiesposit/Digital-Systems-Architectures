# Digital Systems Architectures Project

This repository contains the completed implementation of various digital logic components on Artix-7 FPGAs, developed using the VIVADO software. The specific and detailed documentation of each of the components is provided in the "Documentation.pdf" file.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders, representing the different digital components implemented:

- `1_RETE_DI_INTERCONNESSIONE`: Interconnection Network
- `2_ROM_M_sim`: ROM Simulation
- `2_ROM+M_board`: ROM Board Implementation
- `3_RICONOSCITORE_DI_SEQUENZE`: Sequence Recognizer
- `4_SHIFT_REGISTER`: Shift Register
- `5_CRONOMETRO`: Chronometer
- `5_CRONOMETRO_sim`: Chronometer Simulation
- `6_PO_PC`: PO PC
- `7_MOLT_BOOTH`: Booth Multiplier
- `8_COMUNICAZIONE_CON_HS`: Communication with HS
- `9_PROCESSORE`: Processor
- `10_UART`: UART
- `11_SWITCH_MULTISTADIO`: Multistage Switch
- `12_ESAME_DICEMBRE`: December Exam
- `componenti_base`: Base Components

## Acknowledgments

This project was completed as a collaborative effort by me and my team as part of the Digital Systems Architectures exam.
